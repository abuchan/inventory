Project for grabbing inventory listings from Biomimetics wiki and
dumping them to a CSV file. This project needs to be run from the
login.eecs.berkeley.edu server.

Before running, create a symbolic link to /project/eecs/fearing/wiki/wiki.d
named 'data' in this directory.

Then run ./inventory_grabber.py. It should parse all of the inventory
pages in the wiki, and create a file 'inventory.csv'. This file uses
semicolons as delimiters to allow for lists as attribute values. The first
row is a list of all attribute names encountered in the inventory pages. 
Subsequent rows are entries for each inventory page, beginning with the
inventory item number.
