Project for grabbing inventory listings from Biomimetics wiki and
dumping them to a CSV file. To use this you will need to have a login to
login.eecs.berkeley.edu.

Typing 'make' should run everything for you. This includes pulling all
of the relevant files from the wiki server, parsing the data fields,
and creating the output file 'inventory.csv'. This file uses
semicolons as delimiters to allow for lists as attribute values. The first
row is a list of all attribute names encountered in the inventory pages. 
Subsequent rows are entries for each inventory page, beginning with the
inventory item number.
