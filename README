Project for grabbing inventory listings from Biomimetics wiki and
dumping them to a CSV file. To use this you will need to have an EECS
account on login.eecs.berkeley.edu.

Typing 'make USER=uname', where uname is your login.eecs username,
should run everything for you. The script will prompt for your login.eecs
password.

This includes pulling all of the relevant files from the wiki server, 
parsing the data fields, and creating the output file 'inventory.csv'.
This file uses semicolons as delimiters to allow for lists as attribute
values. The first row is a list of all attribute names encountered in the
inventory pages. Subsequent rows are entries for each inventory page,
beginning with the inventory item number.
